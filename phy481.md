### Overview

Physics 481, Electricity and Magnetism 1, is the first semester of our
two-semester sequence of junior-level classical electromagnetism. It
uses the tools of vector calculus for solving static and dynamic
properties of electromagnetic fields. The topics we will cover include
special cases of static charge distributions (electrostatics),
time-independent current distributions (magnetostatics), electric and
magnetic properties of matter (dielectrics and magnetic media), and,
(time permitting) initial coverage of fully time-dependent problems
(Maxwell's equations). We have many learning goals in this course, which
include content and mathematical skill mastery, high level
problem-solving skills, physical sense-making, deepened conceptual
understanding, communication skills, and connection to other courses and
to the real world. *Required Prerequisites:* **Add here**

#### Required purchases:

1.  J.D. Griffiths. [*Introduction to Electromagnetism*, 4th
    Edition](http://goo.gl/iU6MdA) (Pearson; 2012). This book is
    pedagogically excellent and is my favorite undergrad textbook of
    them all! There are [other editions that might be less
    expensive](http://goo.gl/78y9jw), and they can be substituted. But
    reading assignments will come from the 4th edition, which may have
    some different content.
2.  An "iClicker", available at the bookstore, will be used
    every lecture.

There will be a copy of Griffiths on reserve in the library, along with
several other good texts including the "Feynman Lectures in Physics"
(Vol II is all about E&M, and is wonderful reading), and Pollack and
Stump, "Electromagnetism". This is at Griffith's level, but a little
more mathematical/formal.

### Course Activities

#### Readings

Reading is an essential part of 481! Reading the text before class is
very important. Lecture is to clarify your understanding, to help you
make sense of the material. I will assume you have done the required
readings in advance! Griffiths is one of the best (and most readable)
texts I know of - it will make a huge difference if you spend the time
and effort to carefully read and follow the text. The
[calendar](#calendar) has the details on reading assignments.

#### Class Meetings

Classroom Etiquette: Please turn off all cell phones and pagers when
entering any classroom. Please do not throw vegetables at the
instructor. Private chatter during lecture is very distracting, but it
is perfectly OK to interrupt the lecture by yelling "Question!"
Questions in lecture are always good, and are strongly encouraged!

#### Homework

There will be a homework due every Friday at the start of class. Late
homework can't be accepted once solutions are posted - but, your lowest
score will be dropped. Homework is exceedingly important for developing
an understanding of the course material, not to mention building skills
in complex physical and mathematical problem solving. They will require
considerable time and personal effort this term!

*I strongly encourage collaboration*, an essential skill in science and
engineering (and highly valued by employers!) Social interactions are
critical to scientists' success -- most good ideas grow out of
discussions with colleagues, and essentially all physicists work as part
of a group. Find partners and work on homework together. However, it is
also important that you OWN the material. I strongly suggest you start
homework by yourself (and that means really making an extended effort on
every problem). Then work with a group, and finally, finish up on your
own -- write up your own work, in your own way. There will also be time
for peer discussion during classes -- as you work together, try to help
your partners get over confusions, listen to them, ask each other
questions, critique, teach each other. You will learn a lot this way!
Note: While collaboration is the rule in technical work, evaluations of
individuals also play an important role. Exams will be done without help
from others. For all assignments, the work you turn in must in the end
be your own: in your own words, reflecting your own understanding. (If,
at any time, for any reason, you feel disadvantaged or isolated, contact
me and I can discretely try to help arrange study groups.)

There will be *some use of computation in this course* on homework
problems. I will encourage and support the use of Python (through
Jupyter notebooks). You do not need any computational experience for
this course as you will learn some fundamentals early on and keep using
them throughout the course. You are welcome to use any environment of
your choosing (e.g., Octave/MATLAB, Mathematica, C++), but I will only
provide support for Python. Python is in use across the sciences, but it
is becoming much used in physics, so learning it will serve you well in
your future work. I suggest downloading the [Anaconda distribution of
Python](https://www.continuum.io/) as it comes with all the packages you
will need to get up and running with Jupyter notebooks.

#### Help Sessions

(Times listed at the top of the syllabus) Help sessions/office hours are
to facilitate your learning. We encourage attendance - plan on working
in small groups, our role will be as learning coaches. **DAY OF WEEK**
sessions may involve special problems and activities designed to help
you understand current material, and set you up for the upcoming
homework. **DAY OF WEEK** sessions may be more homework-centric, but we
will not be explicitly telling anyone how to do the homework (how would
that help you learn?) I strongly encourage you to start all problems on
your own. If you come to help sessions "cold", the value of homework to
you will be greatly reduced.

### Grading and Exams

Your course grade is largely determined by a combination of your
performance on exams and homework. There will be some extra credit for
in-class and online participation (which basically "unweights" the exams
- see web for more details.)

**Clickers and online participation:** These activities are pure extra
credit: they REDUCE total midterm weights up to 10% of exam total (i.e.
7% of your grade) See web page for more details.

**Exams:** There are no makeups. You may not miss any exam except for
reasons beyond your control, approved by Prof. Caballero (usually a
confirmed medical problem with written documentation.) In the unusual
case of an (at most, single) excused absence from midterms, I'll use an
average of your other exams. You may bring one side of a single sheet of
8.5 in. x 11 in. paper for each exam, with your own handwritten notes.
Calculators with scientific notation are allowed and sometimes needed.
More details will be announced at the time of the midterm -- see web.

### What we cover, and why:

Physics 481 covers topics in electricity and magnetism (E&M). It is the
first semester of your second course in E&M (Physics 184/294H was the
first), but the first course in a true field theory. Classical
electrodynamics (in the form of Maxwell's equations) is one of the most
successful physical theories that we presently have. While it is a
classical theory (no quantum mechanical Uncertainty Principle here), its
conflicts with Newtonian mechanics motivated Einstein's development of
Special Relativity. Thus, classical E&M is the first relativistically
correct field theory. Also, Maxwell's unification of electricity with
magnetism (at first viewed as separate phenomena) was the first and
grandest example of unification of forces in physics.

For these reasons, along with the sheer mathematical elegance and
completeness of the theory, and its extraordinary (uncanny!) agreement
with experiment, electromagnetism is an inspiration for the creation of
other physical theories including quantum mechanics and quantum field
theory, and indeed much of contemporary physics. Further, classical E&M
is at the root of a huge number of practical applications. Most of the
phenomena of everyday experience, sights, smells, texture, etc. arise
from a balance of electromagnetic interactions and quantum mechanics.
E&M is essential in understanding the physics behind electric power
generation, electronics, optics, communications, (and on, and on!) We
view the universe around us primarily via the electromagnetic radiation.
Clearly, to understand the physical world, we need to understand
electricity and magnetism!

### Comments on preparation:

Physics 481 covers material you have seen before (Many of the topics
stem from PHY 184/294H material) but at a higher level of conceptual and
mathematical sophistication.

Therefore you should expect:

-   a large amount of material covered quickly.
-   no recitations, and few examples covered in lecture. Most homework
    problems are not similar to examples from class.
-   long, hard homework problems that usually cannot be completed by one
    individual alone.
-   challenging exams.

Physics 481 is a challenging, upper‚Äêdivision physics course. Unlike more
introductory courses, you are fully responsible for your own learning.
In particular, you control the pace of the course by asking questions in
class. I tend to speak quickly, and questions are important to slow down
the lecture. This means that if you don't understand something, it is
your responsibility to ask questions. Attending class and the homework
help sessions gives you an opportunity to ask questions. I am here to
help you as much as possible, but I need your questions to know what you
don't understand.

Physics 481 covers some of the most important physics and mathematical
methods in the field. Your reward for the hard work and effort will be
learning important and elegant material that you will use over and over
as a physics major. Here is what I have experienced, and heard from
other faculty teaching upper division physics in the past: 

- most students reported spending a minimum of 10 hours per week on the
homework (!!) 
- students who didn't attend the homework help sessions
often did poorly in the class. 
- students reported learning a tremendous amount in this class.

**The course topics that we will cover in Physics 481 are among the
greatest intellectual achievements of humans. Don't be surprised if you
have to think hard and work hard to master the material.**
