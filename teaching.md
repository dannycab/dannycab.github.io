### Want a Recommendation Letter?

I am very happy to write recommendation letters, but if you want me to
write a letter or letters for you there are several things that I need.
I realize that the list is rather long, but just remember that the more
information you can give me, the better of a letter I can write!

**Key points:**
-   **All** of the information listed below should be provided
    **electronically** (in pdf/MS word/text file form) at least **2
    weeks** prior to the deadline.
-   I will **only** write confidential letters.
-   If you want me to write multiple letters, please give me the
    information for all of them at the same time. This will help me to
    ensure that I don't accidentally forget to submit one or more
    letters due to requests being buried in my inbox. (Note: Med school
    letters all go through Interfolio, so this isn't relevant for that
    type of letter.)

**Information I need to write a letter:**
I need the following information, in electronic (pdf, word, rtf, text
file) form that is sent to me **in a single email**. Please do not give
me paper copies - it's far easier for me to keep track of digital
copies!

1.  A description of **what you are applying for**: is it some sort of
    academic honor? Medical school? Dental School? Graduate school? This
    information is necessary so that I can provide the correct level and
    variety of detail.
2.  If you are applying to med/dental/vet school, do you have a
    specialization in mind at this time? (For example, oncology,
    pediatric medicine, large-animal medicine,
    reconstructive dentistry...) What made you decide on this
    specialization?
3.  A note explaining **why you are asking me to write a letter** for
    you and **who else will be writing letters** for you. This helps me
    to adjust the content of my letter appropriately.
4.  A bullet-point list of **things you would specifically like me to
    talk about** in my letter. This isn't meant to be a draft letter for
    me, but should be things that I should remember when I write a
    letter for you. This can include standard things from your CV (how I
    got to know you, prizes won, etc.) but should also include relevant
    anecdotes to make useful stories about you and your work (i.e.,
    received perfect scores on all exams, first author of a research
    paper as a junior, etc.). This is **not** the time for modesty: you
    need to remind me of how amazing you are so I can emphasize this in
    my letter!
5.  A copy of your **current transcript** (unofficial is fine - MSU
    students, just go to StuInfo and send me a pdf of your
    grade report).
6.  A copy of your **resume and/or CV**.
7.  **MCAT/GRE** scores (if available).
8.  Your **personal statement(s)** / application essay.
9.  If you took one of my senior capstone courses, please give me a copy
    of one or two of the papers you wrote for my course.
10. **List** of schools to which you will be applying and due dates (Not
    relevant for med school letters, since it all goes
    through Interfolio).
11. The name and title of the person who will receive the completed
    letter, if relevant.
12. Any **forms** that need to be filled out or signed, with information
    about you (your address, birth date, etc.) **already filled in**.
13. If letters have to be submitted electronically: a list of the URLs
    or email addresses where I should send the letters. **Med school
    applicants:** Interfolio will send out an email, ignore this.
14. If letters are to be mailed: a list of the organizations and people
    that the letters should be sent to **AND** addressed, stamped
    envelopes of the appropriate size and postage. Leave the return
    address area blank - I will fill this in myself.
