I"h<p>Iâ€™ve found myself using github more and more for work - research, classes, code development. So I decided to move my most of my workflow to github. In the process, I discovered <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which I am now using for all my web posting needs. My <a href="http://pa.msu.edu/~caballero">old web page</a> redirects here now.</p>
