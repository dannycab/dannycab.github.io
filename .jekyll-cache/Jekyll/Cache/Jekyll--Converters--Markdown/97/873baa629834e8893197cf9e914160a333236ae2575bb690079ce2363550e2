I"ò<p>I work with several research groups that focus on different aspects of education.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://perl.natsci.msu.edu">The Physics Education Research Lab</a> conducts a variety of research into studentsâ€™ relationships with physics, how tools and environments shape those relationships, and the conditions that can influence or medrate those relationships.</li>
  <li><a href="https://learningmachineslab.github.io">The Learning Machines Labs</a> conducts quantitative education research using the tools of data science and machine learning to develop quantitative evidence for educational claims. It focuses its efforts on STEM education research.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/">The Center for Computing in Science Education</a> conducts research into students learning of computation in science environments and studies the tools and conditions that lead to different forms of learning. This research is conducted almost exclusively in Norway.</li>
  <li><a href="https://msu-cerl.github.io">The Computational Education Research Lab</a> conducts research into student learning and engagement in computational and data science and the environments and conditions that shape that learning and participation.</li>
</ul>
