I"ˆ<p>I have been struggling to implement a low-stakes quiz process for my class with <a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/post/u-m-msu-and-more-suspend-face-face-classes-precaution-against-spread-coronavirus">MSU cancelling face-to-face instruction</a>. Historically, I have given half-class quizzes every two weeks (partially) in lieu of exams for this class. I have never liked giving traditional exams to students because they are high-stakes, flawed assessments of learning. This class uses longer projects for most of its assessment, but I still give short quizzes to check how students have developed some of the canonical ideas that are part of the class. Hereâ€™s an <a href="../../../assets/sample_quiz.pdf">example quiz</a>. I try to have students engage with the core concepts, explain or argue some aspects around it, and make use of different representations of the problem as they do.</p>
