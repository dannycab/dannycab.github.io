I"¢<p>David Hu, a professor at Georgia Tech - my PhD alma mater, recently wrote a short, but interesting <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/confessions-of-a-wasteful-scientist/">blog post for Scientific American about his research</a>. In it, he talks about how three of his research projects have been highlighted by <a href="http://www.flake.senate.gov/public/">Senator Jeff Flake (R- AZ)</a> as wasteful science research. Davidâ€™s work represents 15% of the projects highlighted in <a href="http://www.flake.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ef6fcd58-c537-491f-aa06-6f7a81038d0e/sen.-jeff-flake-s-twenty-questions---report.pdf">Flakeâ€™s report</a>.</p>
