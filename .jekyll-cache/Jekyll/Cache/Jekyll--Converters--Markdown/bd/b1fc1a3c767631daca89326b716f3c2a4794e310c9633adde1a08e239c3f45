<p>At this workshop, I served as facilitator of a workshop on writing learning goals (What do you want them to do today?). Much of this workshop was drawn from the materials developed by the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/sei/fac-resources/workshops-clickers-materials-LG.htm">Science Education Initiative at CU Boulder</a>, particularly from <a href="http://sciencegeekgirl.com/">Stephanie Chasteenâ€™s work</a>.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s some of the files associated with the workshop.</p>
