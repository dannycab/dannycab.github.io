As part of [a collaborative NSF grant][local-grant], my colleague gave a workshop on integrating computation into undergraduate courses at the [2016 Fall meeting of the Washington Section of the AAPT][wa-aapt].

This post contains a PDF of the talk and the activity that was completed as part of that workshop as well as a link to the code.
