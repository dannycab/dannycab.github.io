### PICUP Developer's Workshop (June 13, 2016)

At this workshop, I served as facilitator of a workshop on writing learning goals (What do you want them to do today?). Much of this workshop was drawn from the materials developed by the [Science Education Initiative at CU Boulder][sei], particularly from [Stephanie Chasteen's work][stephwork].

Here's some of the files associated with the workshop.
