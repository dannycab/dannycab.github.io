### Testing out an idea (Computational Implementation Space)

A couple of my colleagues of mine are working on an idea of mapping the space of implementing computation in physics courses. This idea stems from the work in our shared NSF project to help [university faculty embed computation into their courses][fdw]. I wanted to see what the Twitter-verse thought on this concept of mapping the space.

Here's the initial tweet that I sent out to get feedback from folks:

So it appears the horizontal axis is nailed down: increasing levels of student activity, engagement, or increasing level of skill needed, but the vertical seems to need some work. 

What do you think? Leave ideas in the comments.
