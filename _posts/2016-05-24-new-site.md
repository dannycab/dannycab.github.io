I've found myself using github more and more for work - research, classes, code development. So I decided to move my most of my workflow to github. In the process, I discovered [Jekyll][jekyll-site], which I am now using for all my web posting needs. My [old web page][old-site] redirects here now. 

[jekyll-site]: http://jekyllrb.com/
[old-site]:   http://pa.msu.edu/~caballero
