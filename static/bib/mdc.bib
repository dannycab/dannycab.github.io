Any graduate director, faculty member, or graduate student can recount their own vivid experience with that complicated and, quite often, opaque process.3 At Michigan State University, we set out to understand the admissions process, determine how it was functioning, and make changes to it. We hoped to admit more diverse candidates to our program, evaluate them more equitably and holistically, and, ultimately, create a more inclusive program where each student is valued and supported in their studies. We are far from our ideal collective vision but feel that our progress toward that vision is nonetheless important to share with our colleagues.}",

abstract = {About 15 years ago, education researchers conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on change strategies for improving undergraduate STEM education instruction. Analyzing 191 articles from 1995 to 2008, the researchers identified four broad categories of change strategies through a comprehensive interdisciplinary literature review: (1) disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, (2) developing reflective teachers, (3) enacting policy, and (4) developing a shared vision. With recent developments in STEM education practices, it is imperative to conduct a follow-up SLR comparing the effects of change strategies and associated student success. Similarly, with the influx of scientific articles published in recent decades, it is time consuming to conduct comprehensive SLRs without the assistance of machine learning (ML) analysis techniques. Working with qualitative researchers, we investigate the impact and ability of using ML to assist in these analyses. While most ML approaches can be easily written with a few lines of code, using them to extract meaningful information for literature reviews is challenging. In this work, we describe our experience with integrating machine learning techniques into the analysis pipeline of SLRs. Specifically, this poster will: (1) share results from clustering analysis to identify themes of the chosen abstracts, (2) explore the effects of data bias on found clusters, (3) present the challenges of adding machine learning into SLRs, and (4) assess if the addition of ML in SLRs aligns with the expected goals of qualitative researchers.},

abstract = {Data science is often heralded as a key learning goal for students in STEM classrooms. There are also myriad efforts to integrate data science into these classrooms, and many dedicated research efforts for identifying the best ways to do so. However, the problem is that there is little agreement on how to introduce data science to students, whether it be through computer science courses where students can learn programming, through STEM courses where students can learn disciplinary knowledge, or through newly designed data science centric courses. Furthermore, best practices for teaching data science require an understanding of what data science is from students' perspectives, and how they experience it. This poster explores this problem by showcasing an interview study of an undergraduate course offered at Michigan State University, which focuses on computational modeling and data analysis. Students in this course learn data science via problem-based group work and apply it to several disciplinary contexts. The interview study examines how students perceived what they learned, and how their self-efficacy developed over the course of the semester. In effect, we demonstrate a course where students are learning data science, identify the key features of the course that students perceive, and build an understanding of data science self-efficacy, which can be used to help design positive, effective experiences in data science courses.},
