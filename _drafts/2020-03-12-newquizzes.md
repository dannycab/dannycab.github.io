I have been struggling to implement a low-stakes quiz process for my class with [MSU cancelling face-to-face instruction][cancel]. Historically, I have given half-class quizzes every two weeks in lieu of exams for this class. I have never liked giving traditional exams to students because they are high-stakes, flawed assessments of learning. This class uses longer projects for assessment, but I still give short quizzes to ensure students have developed some of the canonical ideas that are part of the class. Here's an [example quiz][quiz]. I try to have students engage with the core concepts, explain or argue some aspects around it, and make use of  different representations of the problem as they do.

Until now, students completed their quizzes in class and I would scan them to upload to [Gradescope][gs], which we have started using for grading homework and quizzes online. It's a great service and works really well for the grading we do in this class. Going to [virtual classes][class] means that I cannot deliver quizzes in class. Supervising them taking the quizzes via Zoom seems silly and a little too "big brother-y" for me. So having them complete them on their own time seems reasonable. Students will also need some flexiblity in turning them in as they might complete them at different times; Gradescope can certainly handle this.

I know what people might think about this process though: how do you keep them from cheating?!?! Well, side-stepping the issue that most faculty think all their students are dirty little cheaters and will take every potential advantage to do so, I'm not particularly concerned about that. I trust my students to make decisions about how to take their quizzes when they do so in class and I strongly encourage collaboration on homework and projects.

But, the lack of face-to-face instruction has given me a new idea for quizzes that I think will do more for student learning than my giving them a quiz and grading it. I will be asking my students to construct their own quiz and provide a solution to it. That is, each student will write a quiz based on a concepts we cover in class and will then solve that quiz -- tunring in the quiz, their rationale for the quiz, and their solution to it.

This will allow them to be creative in their I also think it deals with the issue of unauthorized collaboration in a novel way. It allows the students the time to complete the "quiz" that the might need and shifts their studying to do well on my quizzes to digesting the material to create their own quiz.
