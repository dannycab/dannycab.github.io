### My Introduction to Learning Analytics

This week, I'm attending the [2016 Learning Analytics Summer Institute][lasi] at the University of Michigan. I'm not a learning analytics researcher, but I am quite interested in what this emerging field is and what they seem to be interested in understanding. From what I can tell so far, it's a very diverse field. Educational researchers, sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, computer scientists, and folks from many other fields are coming together to understand student learning.

I'm still trying to understand what they do, but my particular interest is looking at pathways into and out of STEM (physics, in particular).
