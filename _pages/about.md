Hi! 

I work in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://pa.msu.edu/) and the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/). I hold the Lappan-Phillips Chair of Physics Education, co-direct the [Physics Education Research Lab](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu/), serve as a principal investigator for the [Learning Machines Lab](https://learningmachineslab.github.io/), conduct research as part of the newly-founded [Computational Education Research Lab](https://msu-cerl.github.io/), and hold an appointment as research faculty at the [University of Osloâ€™s Center for Computing in Science Education](https://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/). I study how tools and science practices affect student learning in physics and computational science, and the conditions and environments that support or inhibit this learning.

I earned his B.S. in physics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://ph.utexas.edu/) in 2004. I worked on [opto-microfluidics transport and control experiments](https://schatzlab.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://physics.gatech.edu/about) earning my M.S. in physics before shifting my research focus to physics education. I helped found the [Georgia Tech Physics Education Research group](https://per.gatech.edu/) in 2007 and earned the first physics education focused Ph.D. from Georgia Tech in 2011 working on computational modeling instruction and practice. I moved to the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/per/) as a postdoctoral researcher and helped [transform upper-division physics courses](https://www.colorado.edu/per/resources/course-materials) to more active learning environments.

I conduct research from the high school to the upper-division. I am particularly interested in how students learn through their use of tools such as mathematics and computing. My work employs cognitive and sociocultural theories of learning and aims to blend these perspectives to enhance physics and computational science instruction at all levels. My projects range from the fine-grained (e.g., how students engage with particular computational ideas) to the course-scale (e.g., what kind of computing students are able to do after instruction) to the very broad (e.g., how do departments value computation). My work includes the use of data science to address questions in STEM education.
