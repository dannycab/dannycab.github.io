## Concept and Focus

This page organizes the materials for contributing authors to the upcoming book on Computing in Physics Education. This book was developed from an initial request by editors from the [Institute of Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/) to author a book on the integrating of computing into physics courses. The concept has developed into an edited volume that focuses on a variety of stories from different persons and places around the world who are teaching computing in their physics courses.


## Timeline

The timeline for the book is as follows:

- **Dec 2023**: Initial Concepts and Chapter Proposals
- **Feb 2024**: Reviews and Meeting with Authors
- **Mar 2024**: Accepted Chapter Authors Notified
- **Aug 2024**: First Drafts Due
- **Oct 2024**: Reviews and Meeting with Authors
- **Dec 2024**: Final Drafts Due

## Materials for Contributing Authors

Below are the materials needed for contributing authors to prepare their chapters. Chapters should be roughly 12-18 pages in length and should be written in LaTeX or Google Docs/Word. The final book will be published by IOP.

### Identifying Information (Needed by Apr 15, 2024)

Information is needed from authors for IOP to prepare contracts. Please [complete this following form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5QJ8VfeEADaeuqTEH_NSmtb6U4PLRLG6RlRyOiPN1g/edit#gid=1632730539) by Apr 15, 2024.
