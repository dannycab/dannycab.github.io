## Learning Goals

### Course-Scale Learning Goals

This list represents what we want students to be able to do at the end
of the course (as opposed to what content is expected to be covered, as
in a syllabus).

1. **Math/physics connection:** Students should be able to translate a
physical description of a junior-level electromagnetism problem to a
mathematical equation necessary to solve it. Students should be able to
explain the physical meaning of the formal and/or mathematical
formulation of and/or solution to a junior-level electromagnetism
problem. Students should be able to achieve physical insight through the
mathematics of a problem.
2. **Visualize the problem:** Students should be able to sketch the
physical parameters of a problem (e.g., E or B field, distribution of
charges, polarization), as appropriate for a particular problem.
3. **Organized knowledge:** Students should be able to articulate the big
ideas from each chapter, section, and/or lecture, thus indicating that
they have organized their content knowledge. They should be able to
filter this knowledge to access the information that they need to apply
to a particular physical problem, and make connections/links between
different concepts.
4. **Communication.** Students should be able to justify and explain their
thinking and/or approach to a problem or physical situation, in either
written or oral form.
5. **Problem-solving techniques:** Students should be able to choose and
apply the problem-solving technique that is appropriate to a particular
problem. This indicates that they have learned the essential features of
different problem-solving techniques (eg., separation of variables,
method of images, direct integration). They should be able to apply
these problem-solving approaches to novel contexts (i.e., to solve
problems which do not map directly to those in the book), indicating
that they understand the essential features of the technique rather than
just the mechanics of its application. They should be able to justify
their approach for solving a particular problem.
    - **Approximations:** Students should be able to recognize when
    approximations are useful, and use them effectively (eg., when the
    observer is very far away from or very close to the source).
    Students should be able to indicate how many terms of a series
    solution must be retained to obtain a solution of a given order.
    - **Series Expansions:** Students should be able to recognize when a
    series expansion is appropriate to approximate a solution, and
    complete a Taylor Series to two terms.
    - **Symmetries:** Students should be able to recognize symmetries and
    be able to take advantage of them in order to choose the appropriate
    method for solving a problem (eg., when to use Gauss' Law, when to
    use separation of variables in a particular coordinate system).
    - **Integration:** Given a physical situation, students should be able
    to write down the required partial differential equation, or line,
    surface or volume integral, and correctly calculate the answer.
    - **Superposition:** Students should recognize that – in a linear
    system – the solutions may be formed by superposition of components.
6. **Problem-solving strategy:** Students should be able to draw upon an
organized set of content knowledge (LG\#3), and apply problem-solving
techniques (LG\#4) to that knowledge in order to organize and carry out
long analyses of physical problems. They should be able to connect the
pieces of a problem to reach the final solution. They should recognize
that wrong turns are valuable in learning the material, be able to
recover from their mistakes, and persist in working to the solution even
though they don't necessarily see the path to the solution when they
begin the problem. Students should be able to articulate what it is that
needs to be solved in a particular problem and know when they have
solved it.
7. **Expecting and checking solution:** When appropriate for a given
problem, students should be able to articulate their expectations for
the solution to a problem, such as direction of the field, dependence on
coordinate variables, and behavior at large distances. For all problems,
students should be able to justify the reasonableness of a solution they
have reached, by methods such as checking the symmetry of the solution,
looking at limiting or special cases, relating to cases with known
solutions, checking units, dimensional analysis, and/or checking the
scale/order of magnitude of the answer.
8. **Intellectual maturity:** Students should accept responsibility for
their own learning. They should be aware of what they do and don't
understand about physical phenomena and classes of problem. This is
evidenced by asking sophisticated, specific questions; being able to
articulate where in a problem they experienced difficulty; and take
action to move beyond that difficulty.
9. **Maxwell's Equations:** Students should see the various laws in the
course as part of the coherent field theory of electromagnetism; ie.,
Maxwell's equations.
10. **Build on Earlier Material.** Students should deepen their
understanding of Phys 184 (Freshman Electricity and Magnetism)
material. I.e., the course should build on earlier material.

-   Students should be able to solve for the coefficients in the series
    solution for V, by expanding the potential or charge distribution in

    of the special functions, and express the final answer as a sum over
    these coefficients.
