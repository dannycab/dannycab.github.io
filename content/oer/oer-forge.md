OER-Forge is an open-source platform designed to empower educators, students, and institutions to create, share, and distribute open educational resources (OER) with ease. As the primary developer and maintainer of OER-Forge, I am committed to supporting accessible and high-quality educational content for a global audience.

## What is OER-Forge?

OER-Forge streamlines the process of publishing educational materials by accepting content in multiple formats, including Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and Word documents. The platform automatically converts these materials into a fully accessible website that adheres to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), ensuring that resources are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities.

> OER-Forge is being actively developed and improved based on user feedback and emerging best practices in open education. Some features are working, some are in testing, and others are planned for future releases. 

## Key Features (planned and implemented)

- **Multi-format Input:** Authors can submit content as Markdown files, Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), or Word documents (`.docx`), making it easy to leverage existing materials.
- **Accessible Output:** All published resources are converted into a WCAG-compliant website, promoting inclusivity and accessibility.
- **Flexible Export Options:** Users can download resources in a variety of formats, such as plain text (`.txt`), LaTeX (`.tex`), Markdown (`.md`), Word (`.docx`), PDF (`.pdf`), and Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), supporting diverse teaching and learning needs.
- **Open Source:** The entire platform is open source, encouraging collaboration and transparency. Contributions from the community are welcome.

## Why OER-Forge?

The need for accessible, adaptable, and openly licensed educational resources has never been greater. OER-Forge addresses this by providing a simple workflow for educators to publish and share materials without technical barriers. By supporting multiple input and output formats, OER-Forge ensures that resources can be reused, remixed, and redistributed in ways that best serve learners and educators alike.
