The **Open Physics Education Network** is, presently, a personal initiative dedicated to making physics education accessible to everyone, regardless of background or resources. Rooted in the belief that everyone can learn physics, the project addresses the barriers created by limited access to quality materials and the restrictive practices of commercial publishing.

This network emphasizes the use of free and open source educational resources, ensuring that all materials are openly licensed and adaptable for diverse learning environments. Accessibility is a core value: all resources are developed following WCAG-compliant guidelines, making content usable for people with disabilities. Materials are offered in multiple formats—such as web, PDF, and DOCX—to support a wide range of devices and learning preferences.

While currently a solo effort, the project welcomes future collaboration and contributions. The goal is to provide lesson plans, problem sets, interactive tools, and multimedia content that can be freely shared, remixed, and improved by the community. By lowering barriers to high-quality physics education, the Open Physics Education Network seeks to empower both educators and learners, counteracting the negative impacts of commercial publishing on access and equity.

Through openness, accessibility, and a commitment to educational justice, this initiative aims to inspire more people to explore and succeed in physics.
