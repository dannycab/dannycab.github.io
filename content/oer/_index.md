# Open Educational Resources

I create and share open educational resources (OER) to support teaching and learning in physics and computational science. These resources are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute under a Creative Commons license. All of these resources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dannycab/).

## Course Materials

I publish all of my course materials as open educational resources. You can find links to these materials on my [teaching page](/teaching/). These materials include lecture notes, assignments, and projects for courses I teach at Michigan State University. Feel free to use and adapt these resources for your own teaching needs. I am moving all of my course materials to OER-Forge, so please check back often for updates!
