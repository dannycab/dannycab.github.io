I'm thrilled to share that our edited book for ["Computing in Physics Education"](/iop-book/) has officially been submitted to the Institute of Physics Publishing (IOP). This book represents a collaborative effort among educators and practitioners who are passionate about integrating computational methods into physics teaching and learning. Over the past year, contributors from diverse institutions and backgrounds have come together to share their experiences, insights, and innovative approaches to bringing computation into the physics classroom.

The volume covers a wide range of topics, from introductory programming activities to advanced computational modeling projects. Each chapter highlights practical strategies, curricular frameworks, and real-world examples that demonstrate how computation can enhance students' understanding of physics concepts. The book also addresses common challenges faced by instructors, such as selecting appropriate tools, designing effective assessments, and supporting students with varying levels of programming experience.

Our goal with this book is to provide a valuable resource for physics educators at all levelsâ€”whether you are just beginning to explore computational integration or are looking to deepen your existing practice. We hope that the stories and strategies shared in these pages will inspire more instructors to embrace computation as a core component of physics education.

Stay tuned for updates on the publication timeline and availability. Thank you to everyone who contributed their expertise and enthusiasm to this project!
