[OER Forge](https://oerforge.org) is an open educational resource (OER) platform that I developed to facilitate the creation, sharing, and dissemination of high-quality educational materials. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, allowing educators and learners to easily find and use resources that meet their needs.
