## Quick gist (from IOP)
For decades physics teaching changed little while computation became central to science. This book collects real-world examples of how instructors worldwide are weaving computational thinking into undergraduate physics: curriculum ideas, learning goals, assessment tips, student and faculty perspectives, and ready-to-use materials (simulations, notebooks, etc.). Useful if your department wants to modernize courses and broadly applicable across STEM.

## First Chapter is Freely Available

Note: I previously [posted the first chapter](../iop-book-chapter-posted/); that chapter remains available:
