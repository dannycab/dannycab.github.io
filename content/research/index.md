I work with [several research groups](#groups) that focus on different aspects of education. I've had the chance to work on a few projects. Here are some [recent ones](#current-projects) and here are some [older ones](#older-projects).  I've given a number of presentations about this work. Here's a sample of some of the [more recent ones](#presentations). My full list of publications is available [here](https://dannycab.github.io/pubs/).

## groups

* [The Physics Education Research Lab (PERL)](https://perl.natsci.msu.edu) conducts a variety of research into students' relationships with physics, how tools and environments shape those relationships, and the conditions that can influence or moderate those relationships. PERL is housed in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://pa.msu.edu/).
* [The Computational Education Research Lab (CERL)](https://msu-cerl.github.io) conducts research into student learning and engagement in computational and data science and the environments and conditions that shape that learning and participation. CERL is housed in the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/).
* [The Center for Computing in Science Education (CCSE)](https://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/) conducts research into students' learning of computing in science environments, studies the tools and conditions that lead to different forms of learning, and develops text-embedding tools for qualitative research. Research with CCSE is conducted almost exclusively in Norway.
