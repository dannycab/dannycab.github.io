I'm passionate about teaching and helping people learn. I work to create inclusive, evidence-based learning environments in physics and computational science. My teaching work includes:

- **[OER Course Materials](/teaching/courses/)** — Physics and computational science courses
- **[OER Teaching Tools](/teaching/tools/)** — Open source software for teaching and learning
- **[Educational Initiatives](/teaching/initiatives/)** — Community work and professional development

## Teaching Philosophy

I love helping people learn. I was fortunate to be selected by MSU for [a video highlighting my commitment to teaching](https://youtube.com/watch?v=xkZooG2Nk8Q). The video features students from the Spring 2019 PHY 482 class. I strive to create learning environments that are equitable, inclusive, and grounded in evidence about how people learn best.
