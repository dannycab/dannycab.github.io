I love helping people learn.  I strive to create learning environments that are equitable, inclusive, and grounded in evidence about how people learn best. My teaching work includes:

- **[OER Course Materials](/teaching/courses/)** — Physics and computational science courses
- **[OER Teaching Tools](/teaching/tools/)** — Open source software for teaching and learning
- **[Educational Initiatives](/teaching/initiatives/)** — Community work and professional development

## Courses

I teach a variety of courses in physics and computational science. Some courses have publicly available materials:

- **Spring 2026** – [PHY 321 (Classical Mechanics)](/phy321msu)
- **Fall 2025** – [PHY 321 (Classical Mechanics)](/phy321msu)
- **Before Fall 2025** - [Past Courses](/teaching/courses/)
