## Concept and Focus

This page organizes the materials for contributing authors to the upcoming book on Computing in Physics Education. This book was developed from an initial request by editors from the [Institute of Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/) to author a book on the integrating of computing into physics courses. The concept has developed into an edited volume that focuses on a variety of stories from different persons and places around the world who are teaching computing in their physics courses.
