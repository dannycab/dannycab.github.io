groups

The Physics Education Research Lab (PERL) conducts a variety of research into students&rsquo; relationships with physics, how tools and environments shape those relationships, and the conditions that can influence or moderate those relationships. PERL is housed in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
The Computational Education Research Lab (CERL) conducts research into student learning and engagement in computational and data science and the environments and conditions that shape that learning and participation. CERL is housed in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering.
The Center for Computing in Science Education (CCSE) conducts research into students&rsquo; learning of computing in science environments, studies the tools and conditions that lead to different forms of learning, and develops text-embedding tools for qualitative research. Research with CCSE is conducted almost exclusively in Norway.
