Founded on the belief that computational skills are essential for modern physicists, PICUP works to empower instructors at all levels to bring computational thinking and practices into their classrooms.\nPICUP provides a wide range of resources and support for educators, including a curated collection of open educational resources (OER), teaching modules, and sample activities that can be readily adopted or adapted for various physics courses. The community also organizes workshops, webinars, and conferences designed to help instructors develop the skills and confidence needed to teach computation effectively. These professional development opportunities foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among educators, helping to build a supportive network for those new to computational instruction as well as experienced practitioners.\nA key aspect of PICUP’s mission is to lower the barriers to integrating computation into physics courses. The partnership offers guidance on curriculum development, assessment strategies, and best practices for incorporating coding and computational modeling into both introductory and advanced physics classes. By providing practical tools and fostering a collaborative environment, PICUP enables educators to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes through computational approaches.\nPICUP’s impact extends beyond resource development and professional support. The organization actively advocates for the broader adoption of computational methods in physics education, working with academic institutions, professional societies, and funding agencies to promote systemic change. Through its outreach and advocacy efforts, PICUP has played a significant role in shaping national conversations about the future of physics education.\nIn recognition of its outstanding contributions to physics education, PICUP was awarded the prestigious 2023 American Physical Society (APS) Excellence in Physics Education Award. This honor, often referred to as the APS Education Prize, is given annually to individuals or groups who have made significant and sustained contributions to physics education. The award acknowledges PICUP’s leadership in building a national community of practice, developing high-quality resources, and advancing the integration of computation into undergraduate physics instruction. The collective efforts of PICUP’s members have had a transformative impact on the way physics is taught and learned, inspiring educators and benefiting students across the country.\nFor more information about PICUP, its resources, and upcoming events, visit the PICUP website.\n",
